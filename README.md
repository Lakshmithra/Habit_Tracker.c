Habit Tracker in C

This is a simple and purposeful console-based habit tracker built using C.
It allows you to log a daily habit, track your progress over time, and stay consistent using a lightweight text-based system.

This is my first C project, created to practice file handling, structures, and basic user interaction in C.

Features

- Stores your name, habit, streak, and last update date
- Prevents duplicate entries for the same day
- Updates or resets your streak based on daily input
- Displays motivational messages to encourage consistency

How to Run

Compile:
gcc habit_tracker.c -o habit_tracker

Run:
./habit_tracker

File Used

Habit_Tracker.txt  

Stores user data in this format:
- Name
- Habit
- Streak count
- Last updated date (in dd-mm-yyyy format)
